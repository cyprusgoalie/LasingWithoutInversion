@article{Kilin2008,
abstract = {We explore a three-level Lambda scheme to demonstrate that the phenomenon of lasing without inversion (LWI) can be observed in the transient regime. We demonstrate that the pure LWI contribution to the gain of a probe field is distinct from both the resonant absorption (or gain) and the coherent Raman gain (or absorption) by choosing specific initial populations in the dressed-state basis. The suppression of the non-LWI (resonant and Raman) processes is followed by the "rich get richer" (capitalistic) effect for the ground-state population dynamics: Initially, the more populated ground state becomes even more populated. The conditions for the observation of the effect are specified.},

The appearance of lasing without inversion is the result of atomic coherence induced between two lower levels by a Raman process.

We identify the conditions for ideal lasing without inversion.},

@article{Marthaler2011,
abstract = {We study the photon generation in a transmission line oscillator coupled to a driven qubit in the presence of a dissipative electromagnetic environment. It has been demonstrated previously that a population inversion in the qubit may lead to a lasing state of the oscillator. Here we show that the circuit can also exhibit the effect of "lasing without inversion". This is possible since the coupling to the dissipative environment enhances photon emission as compared to absorption, similar to the recoil effect which was predicted for atomic systems. While the recoil effect is very weak, and so far elusive, the effect described here should be observable with present circuits. We analyze the requirements for the system parameters and environment.},

abstract = {This review paper is devoted to amplification and lasing without population inversion involving atomic transitions in gas media. We start by discussing the main motivation in inversionless lasing research, namely, the generation of short-wavelength laser light. Then, we review the basic physics of inversionless lasing in two-level and, eventually, in three- and multilevel atomic configurations. Finally, we summarize the current state of the art of LWI experiments and indicate the main difficulties with respect to short-wavelength laser generation.},
